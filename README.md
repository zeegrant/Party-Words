MVP GOALS: 
* To Allow words to randomly populate into the game
* To Allow win/lose logic to be able to show
* Show balloons on the screen that disappear with every incorrect guess.


MAJOR HURDLES: 
The coding function to enter the balloons to instead of sticks were more difficult/ambitious than originally thought. Initially had a ton of issues randomization of words.
